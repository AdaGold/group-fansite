# Coworking Agreement
Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
Jasmine: Helpful to have a written gameplan during pair coding
Trang: Helpful to have a reserved room during coworking hours (on Thursday)

## Collaboration vs. individual work expectations
We're going to pair program during coworking times. If we run out of coworking time, we can then divvy up the remaining work to do individually.
Use Study Hall or Auditorium when working together virtually. Share screen for coding.

## Learning Style
Trang: It's messy. 
Jasmine: Lots of verbal processing. Helpful to hear other people's thoughts.
Kim: Needs a moment to read first before attempting something.

## Preferred Feedback Style
Trang: People can be as straightforward and explicit as possible.
Jasmine: Ditto. 
Kim: Ditto x2. Appreciates visual explanations when given feedback.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
Trang: Wants to work on not interrupting people.
Jasmine: Ditto. Also want to work on contributing to making decisions.
Kim: Wants to be more honest about whether she understands something. (Trang says Ditto)

## Optional: Other agreements
Scheduled coworking times OK for pair coding except Friday (Trang out)
Goal: Finish by Thursday Night
