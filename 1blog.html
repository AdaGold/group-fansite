        <h3>The Firsts Month and a Half: A Reflection</h3>
        <p>Resting has become a serious endeavor for me; as an Ada student one must be very diligent about how one rests. Without rest I cannot function properly and I cannot retain any new information; I have learned this the hard way. Computer programming is different than other forms of work I’ve participated in, specifically, it’s quite different than my experience in classic academic endeavors.</p>
        <p>Programming requires one to hold several moving structures in your mind and watch them interact. Similar to a mobile above a baby’s crib if one pushes on one side, the opposing side will pop up and all of the artifacts dangling by a string are at the mercy of the movement. This could be exactly what one wants or could cause a disaster. Beyond the theoretical structures that exist, one must be aware of how the code that builds those structures is written. Lastly, one must have an    idea of coding tools available and must be able to weave the code one would like to execute into the existing code. When I get stuck or break my code it feels as if I’ve forgotten everything I’ve ever learned. If you’re coding alone, you could be at a standstill for hours, unable to figure out the problem. This has been my biggest challenge at Ada so far as I take a lot of pride in being able to figure out things by myself but after much frustration I’ve learned I have to ask for help.</p>
        <p> As I was diligently relaxing, I found the album Space Museum by Solid Space. Delightfully eerie and atmospheric… “The Guests” stands out to me. The contrast between the lighter, sweeter beats and dark, bitter beats is quite lovely. “A Darkness in my Soul” feels ephemeral, as if the song was being echoed through a room by a moody ghost. Overall, the album has earned a spot in my future vinyl collection. Only $187 on eBay… Yikes.</p>
