      Growing up in a war-torn third-world country and immigrating to the U.S as a teenager has given me a broad spectrum perspective on how things could be on two opposite ends of the same coin. Connecting people to access the tools they need to succeed and thrive has always been my passion.

      Curiosity is my middle name. I was that kid taking apart electronics growing up - I needed to know what was in there? How did it work? As an adult, I have always gravitated toward working with engineers to create reporting tools, measure performance workflows, quality assurance, automate repetitive tasks, finding & implementing new software programs. So when COVID hit turning our world upside down, it was an exciting time to dive on the deep end using tech to send our teams remote. I felt at home finding innovative ways to navigate our new reality. Connecting the dots and thinking outside of the box is what drives my engine and I would love the opportunity to be in the tech sector to be at the center of it all where those innovation boxes are made.
