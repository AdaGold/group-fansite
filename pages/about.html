        <p>My name is Tiff (she/they) and I am a student software developer at Ada Developers Academy in Seattle, WA.  Previously, I worked in healthcare as a pharmacist specializing in geriatric and ambulatory medicine where I cared for over 90 patients at a time residing in Assisted Living Facilities or enrolled in PACE programs.
        <p>I earned my Doctor of Pharmacy at the University of New England on the beautiful coast of Maine.  Prior to that, I received my Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science from the University of Washington in Seattle, WA.
            While obtaining a formal education, my interest in technology never waivered.  In every step of my career, I developed small applications to increase the productivity of my work such as creating functions in Excel spreadsheets or by learning bits and pieces
            of code to resolve or add features to pharmacy software.   
        <p>As I retire my white coat for the dual monitors of a developer, I know that the analytical and problem-solving skills I have garnered as a pharmacist will be translatable to a successful career in tech.
            I am passionate about working with gender expansive and BIPOC communities and changing the face of the industry to promote better inclusivity.  I am interested in working with companies who share this philosophy
            and am positive that my background will provide provide me with the tools for a successful transition.
        </p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me outside playing endless games of catch with my partner and our dog Tobi.  I enjoy the simple things in life - like coffee.</p>
