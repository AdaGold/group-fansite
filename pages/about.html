    <p> Lobo is a 6.5 years old mix Alaskan Malanute and Siberian Husky. He is a beautiful sweet rescue boy. Apparently he was bron in Madera California and when he turned 1 year old something happened he got lost, animal services got him at first, he had some aggresive behivour and it was hard for him to find a family then, an asociation rescue him from the city shelter and put him in another sanctuary, after 2 years that he was sent to another sanctuary in Oregon where he was giving a home but the family did not have enough time for him and he got again into the shelter. Finally he was sent to <a href="https:/www.wamal.com/">WAMAL</a> where we found him. He used to be a shy timid dog, mainly afraid of men and he got hard times on desensitize and learning how to trusting in humans again. Right now he is a beloved and cared dog, we are so happy to share our time and our house with him, he is very sweet and lazy dog.

      <h2>Mexican Flan</h2>
      <img src="http://www.mexicanrecipes.me/FlanMexicano.jpg" alt="profile photo" width="300">
      <h2 class="highlight"> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li> 4 oz Cream Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="highlight"> Directions </h2>
    <ul>
    <li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>
      <p>Place sugar in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, and cook, 
        stirring constantly, until the sugar melts and turns a golden amber color, 
        about 10 minutes. Watch carefully once syrup begins to change color, because 
        it burns easily. 
        Carefully pour the melted sugar syrup into a flan mold. Let cool.</p>
      <li><h3>Step 2</h3></li>
      <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
      <li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>
      <p>Pour whole milk, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, egg yolks, orange juice, orange peel, vanilla extract, and cornstarch into a blender, 
      and blend for a minute or so, until the mixture is smooth. Pour in the cream, and pulse several times to incorporate the cream. 
      Pour the mixture over the cooled caramel syrup in the flan mold.</p>
      <li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>
      <p>Pour whole milk, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, egg yolks, orange juice, orange peel, vanilla extract, and cornstarch into a blender, 
        and blend for a minute or so, until the mixture is smooth. Pour in the cream, and pulse several times to incorporate the cream. 
        Pour the mixture over the cooled caramel syrup in the flan mold.</p>
      <li><h3>Step 4</h3></li>
      <p>Line a roasting pan with a damp kitchen towel. Place the flan mold on the towel, inside roasting pan, and place roasting pan on oven rack. 
        Fill roasting pan with boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the baking dish.</p>
      <li><h3>Step 5</h3></li>
      <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the center of the flan is set but still slightly jiggly when moved, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let the flan cool, 
        then refrigerate for at least 4 hours. To serve, run a sharp paring knife around the inside of the mold to release the flan. 
        Invert a plate on the mold, flip the mold over, and gently remove the mold to unmold the flan and reveal the syrupy caramel topping.</p>
    </ul>
