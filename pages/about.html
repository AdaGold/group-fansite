  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> A life-long learner who has met her match in a field that revolves around learning constantly, problem-solving on the fly, and often flying by the seat of your pants.
    Coming from a background in operations, Tara utilizes data to drive solutions that meet needs while sustaining healthy work culture for all. 
    All that has changed is the language (or, languages) used to reach those solutions. </p>
